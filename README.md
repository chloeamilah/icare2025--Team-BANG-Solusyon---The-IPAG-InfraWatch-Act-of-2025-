## Policy Overview
The IPAG–InfraWatch Act of 2025 is a proposed Philippine law that establishes a centralized, tech‑powered, inter‑agency oversight system designed to detect, prevent, and prosecute corruption in infrastructure projects. It mandates real‑time digital monitoring, mandatory data transparency, and joint agency action between Commission on Audit (COA), Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Ombudsman, and civil society partners to ensure infrastructure spending is efficient, transparent, and corruption‑resistant.

## Setup and Installation Guide

### SECTION 1 – Declaration of Policy
The State shall adopt a real‑time, technology‑driven oversight system to prevent corruption in public infrastructure by enforcing transparency, strengthening inter‑agency coordination, and ensuring that all government infrastructure projects comply with budgeting, procurement, and engineering standards.

### SECTION 2 – Creation of the National InfraWatch Platform
Real-Time Project Dashboard (Required Upload Every 72 Hours)
Agencies must upload:

* project name
* location (GPS)
* contractor & subcontractors
* bill of materials
* approved budget vs. actual disbursement
* geotagged progress photos
* timeline status
* change orders & reasons

Penalty for failure to upload data:
* ₱50,000 per missed update (official-in-charge)
* suspension after 3 violations

### SECTION 3 – Automated Red‑Flag Detection System (A‑RFD)
The system automatically scans for corruption indicators such as:
* 20%+ price variance from regional standard costs
* repeated winning of projects by one contractor
* unexplained cost escalation
* zero physical progress after 30 days
* suspicious subcontracting patterns
* mismatched materials vs. budget

When a red flag is detected:
The system automatically sends a case alert to:
*COA Special Audit
*NBI Anti‑Graft Division
*Office of the Ombudsman

They must respond within five (5) days.

### SECTION 4 – IPAG Inter‑Agency Oversight Council
A permanent council composed of:
* 1 COA Commissioner
* 1 DPWH Undersecretary
* 1 NBI Deputy Director
* 1 Ombudsman Representative
* 1 DILG Representative
* 1 licensed civil engineer from the private sector
* 1 civil society group representative

Mandate:
* Quarterly joint field inspections
* Approving red‑flag action plans
* Publishing public quarterly reports

### SECTION 5 – Contractor Integrity Score (CIS)
A scoring system from 0–100 based on:
* audit performance
* quality of past projects
* project delays
* blacklisting history
* safety compliance
* violation reports from communities

Rules:
* Contractors with CIS below 60 are barred from bidding.
* CIS of 40 and below → automatic investigation.

### SECTION 6 – Community Witness & Reporting Program (CWRP)
Citizens living within 5 km of a project can submit:
* poor-quality work
* slow progress
* missing materials
* ghost workers
via the InfraWatch mobile app.

Verified reports:
* ₱5,000 to ₱50,000 reward
* full legal protection
* anonymity preserved

### SECTION 7 – Digital Evidence Case Folder (DECF)
All InfraWatch data automatically forms a tamper-proof digital evidence file that includes:
* Timestamps
* uploaded documents
* photo metadata
* financial logs
* audit findings
This is directly transmitted to the Ombudsman and Sandiganbayan to speed up prosecution.

### SECTION 8 – Penalties
* Government officials who falsify data → 6–12 years imprisonment
* Contractors who fake progress reports → contract termination + 10‑year blacklist
* Agencies that delay uploads → administrative liability
* Tampering with digital evidence → treated as graft and corruption

### SECTION 9 – Funding
Funding from:
* General Appropriations Act
* 1% of DPWH annual budget dedicated to oversight
* fines collected from violations
